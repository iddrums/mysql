# Select Query Interviews
Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are 0 .

Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds 1 screening contest.
